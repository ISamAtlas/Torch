Some things you might like to know, yes I'm aware how incredibly inefficient this is.
In truth, I made this datapack over a year ago, display entities weren't out yet,
I was still learning about the importance of functions, and efficiency with execute commands.
just so you know, I wont be accepting any pull requests (if that's the right word) because I'd
like to keep it how it was in my video.

Oh and, funnily enough, this wasn't actually ever supposed
to be a video, this was supposed to be part of a larger datapack I was
making.

Edit: I just realize I'm talking about how inefficient it is rather than how useless it is
